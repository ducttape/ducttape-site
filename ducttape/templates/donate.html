    <p>
        This project was founded by a team of students spending their spare
        time on open source software and hacking games. If you like our work
        and want to support us, donating a few bucks would be a way to go.
        Remember we don't charge anything for our work, but we have to
        keep up the server and from time to time we need junkfood and
        soft drinks for the gamejams :D
